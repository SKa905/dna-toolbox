Trying out applying what I learn in coding to biology-related stuff

The goal is, when given an input of a sample DNA sequence:
- Identify the promoter sequence, possible regulatory regions, and a likely mutation based on a "normal" version of the same gene, if applicable.
- Provide a complementary DNA sequence, assuming that this DNA sequence is the template strand and is not related to a protein.
- If the DNA strand is related to a protein, providing the mRNA and protein sequence, as well as start codon, that will result from transcription and translation of the DNA strand.
